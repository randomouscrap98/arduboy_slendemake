## Requirements to build
You'll need the following libraries:
- [Arduboy2](https://github.com/MLXXXp/Arduboy2)
- [ArduboyFX](https://github.com/MrBlinky/ArduboyFX)
- [ArduboyRaycast](https://github.com/randomouscrap98/arduboy_raycast)
- [FixedPointsArduino](https://github.com/Pharap/FixedPointsArduino)
- [TinyFont](https://github.com/BotiKis/Arduboy-TinyFont)
- [ArduboyTones](https://github.com/MLXXXp/ArduboyTones)

Map was created with [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/)
Python is required to convert various assets

All assets created by me. Page art redrawn by me, but based on the original page art.

## Extra
This was a labor of love. Slender was an important game to me, and I wanted to recreate it. I know it's 
not a funny game and it's barely a "meme", but oh well!
